# ✋ Hi, I am Akqir

My real name is Andrei, currently a first year Information System student focusing in learning C#. I am actively going to college, at the same time developing programs that might fill my portfolio in the future.

Also, I am a linux enthusiast and love testing new apps, algorithms, and technologies in my free time.
