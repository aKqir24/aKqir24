# âœ‹ __Hi I am Akqir!!__
I'm just a normal computer systems student, and now I am studying `python`, `shell`, `c#`, `css`, `html`, `javascript`, `sql`, and `kotlin` for my future plans in becoming a software developer. My progress has been slow for a while, but I will try my what I can to be able to do it :)
